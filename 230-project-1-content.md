## High Concept

In this game, you have to sneak around robbers and move through the environment to get to the next level.





## Genre

Starbucks Sleuth is a complex puzzle game based on the need to evade enemies and nagivate the environment to get to the goal.





## Platforms

Unfortunately, since Starbucks Sleuth is based off of keyboard inputs, this game would only be available for PC gamers.



## Story

You were just trying to quiety pee in your local Starbucks Super-Complex, when suddenly the lights went out and everybody started to scream. You peek your head out only to realize that the Starbucks is being robbed! It's up to you to travel to the top floor of the complex and stop the robbers from getting away with your precious coffee. You will have to carefully navigate through many dark, crowded, and heavily patrolled rooms to get there and you will most certainly face robbers along the way. It seems scary, but you can do it!



## Esthetics

The game will be made up of partially cartoony sprites and will have ominous ambient noise as you prgress. In times of trouble or fear, you will hear your heart-rate increase and in times of solitude you will hear the scariest sound of all: silence.



## Gameplay

In Starbucks Sleuth, there is always more than one path to get to victory. You can chose how to get to the elevator to get to the next level. The player will use a keyboard and mouse to navigate the game and the menus. The first couple level will be used to introduce ideas and controls for the game.
